        </a>
        <p>
          Everyone who lives in Columbia or any city with major train lines
          running through it knows the pain of waiting for a slow train and
          showing up to your destination 20 minutes late. The problem is not
          knowing the train schedules throughout Columbia and being late because
          of them. The problem is more specifically not knowing the optimal
          route to get to your destination while taking train delays into
          consideration.
